    <p> My name is Jordan Carpenter. I am a second year student at the University Of Rhode Island and switched from my major of marketing to computer science recently. 
    
    <p> One of my favorite passtimes is playing volleyball. No matter on the beach or in a gym, it is my favorite sport to play right next to basketball and football. I also am a video game fanatic and enjoy playing them with my friends. My favorite sports teams are the Patriots, Celtics, and Bruins, but my favorite sport to watch is football. I love all types of music and my favorite movie is The Dark Knight.
